# Password Cracking Application using Distributed Systems
Our project aims to create a distributed system that shall run throughout the internet. The programs will be built using the Java language. The password cracking system is an entirely parallel application consisting of two programs, i.e., the worker client and server. It consists of a set of operations on small chunks of data. No data needs to be shared between different password cracking notes as the crack. They just receive a work unit allocation, try all of the passwords in that unit and tell the server if any of them was a match. The server is responsible for creating and dividing the jobs into parts, which are then allocated to the worker clients.
For the generation of hash, we will be using the MD5 hashing algorithm. The server generates all possible passwords within the range and hashes it to compare it to the actual hash password, then the client successfully cracks the password. If the password received by the client matches then it will print the password, else request for retry or will terminate with a message of failure.
